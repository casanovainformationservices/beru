Basic Ebook Reader for Ubuntu
=============================
Beru is an ebook reader for Ubuntu.  It's built on the the new Ubuntu
Toolkit, so it works best on touch devices.  It behaves resonably on the
desktop, as well. Beru features full support for Epub files and
preliminary support for CBZ and PDF files.

Note: Casanova Information Services will be extending this program.


Building
--------
You will need the [Ubuntu SDK][1].  To build out-of-tree, do
```
$ mkdir <build directory>
$ cd <build directory>
$ cmake <path to source>
$ make
```
Note that Qt Creator will do this automatically for you.

In-tree builds should work, but will not be as tested.

Running
-------
Launch Beru with the shell script `beru`.

Beru keeps a library of epub files.  On every start, a specified folder
is searched and all epubs in it are included in the library.  You may
also pass a epub file to `beru` as an argument.  This will open the file
and add it to your library.

The Library is stored in a local database.  While I won't be
cavalier about changing the database format, it may happen.  If
you're getting database errors after upgrading, delete the database
and reload your files.  The database is one of the ones in
`~/.local/share/com.ubuntu.developer.rschroll.beru/Databases`;
read the `.ini` files to find the one with `Name=BeruLocalBooks`.

Click Packages
--------------
The install option target can be used to help build click packages.
First, run cmake with the `-DCLICK_MODE=ON` option.  Then run from the
build directory
```
make DESTDIR=<directory> install
```
This will fill the directory with the contents for the click package,
which may be assembed with
```
click build <directory>
```
To build clicks from within Qt Creator, add `-DCLICK_MODE=ON` to the
CMake arguments of the build settings.

Note that the click package contains .so files, and is therefore
limited to the architecture on which it was produced.  To produce
click packages for other architectures, you'll need to [cross
compile][2].
